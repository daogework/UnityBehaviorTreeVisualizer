# Community Nodes
The goal of the Behavior Tree Visualizer tool is to make writing and debugging AI easier for all! To help with this, our hope is to facilitate a repository of Nodes that interact with various elements of Unity. A full list of the nodes can be found [here](https://github.com/Yecats/UnityBehaviorTreeVisualizer/wiki/Community-Nodes).

## Contribute
Want to contribute a new community node or fix a bug? You can submit a pull request on the GitHub repository at https://github.com/Yecats/UnityBehaviorTreeVisualizer/. A few things to note:

1. Nodes should be in the **com.wug.behaviortreevisualizer\Samples~\Community Nodes** folder with a sub category folder (i.e. "Navigation").
2. All community nodes must build off the **Standard Nodes** sample project. In other words, if you are creating a new **Decorator**, make sure it inherits from the `Decorator` node. 
3. Documentation, documentation, documentation! Make sure to add comments to explain what your node is doing, parameters that need to be passed, etc.

## Get Help
If you encounter an issue with a community node, please reach out on GitHub and log an issue at https://github.com/Yecats/UnityBehaviorTreeVisualizer/issues or submit a pull request with the fix.
